# Heart Disease Prediction 

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.

## 🔍 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
- Features include age, cholesterol, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, etc.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (best performance)
- Support Vector Machine (optional)

## 📊 Evaluation

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Feature Importance
- ROC Curve (optional)

## 🎯 Final Result

- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy.
- Feature importance and confusion matrix visualizations are included.
